## Submitting your work

Paper submissions are due **{{ submission_deadline }}**. Please make sure that your
paper satisfies all the following requirements before being submitted.
Submissions not adhering to these submission guidelines will be rejected
by the submission system and/or subject to an administrative reject.

-   The paper must have an abstract under 300 words.

-   The paper must be original material that has not been previously
    published in another conference or journal, nor is currently under
    review by another conference or journal. You may submit material
    presented previously at a workshop without copyrighted proceedings.

-   The submission is limited to ten (10) pages in the ACM 8.5" x
    11" (US letter size paper) using 9pt font, with
    no more than 7 lines per inch. This page limit applies to all
    content NOT INCLUDING references, and there is no page limit for
    references. Your paper must print satisfactorily on both Letter
    paper (8.5"x11") and A4 paper (8.27"x11.69"). The box containing the
    text should be no larger than 7.15"x9" (18.2cm x 22.9cm).

-   Anonymized supplementary material may be provided in a single PDF
    file uploaded at paper submission time, containing material that
    support the content of the paper, such as proofs, additional
    experimental results, data sets, etc. Reviewers are not required to
    read the supplementary material but may choose to do so.

-   Papers are to be submitted for double-blind review. Blind reviewing
    of papers will be done by the program committee, assisted by outside
    referees. Author names as well as hints of identity are to be
    removed from the submitted paper.

-   Use care in naming your files. Source file names (e.g.,
    Joe.Smith.dvi) are often embedded in the final output as readily
    accessible comments. In addition, do not omit references to provide
    anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context.
    Instead, if you are extending your own work, you need to reference
    and discuss the past work in third person, as if you were extending
    someone else's research.

-   We realize in doing double-blind review that for some papers it will
    still be obvious who the authors are. In this case, the submission
    will not be penalized if a concerted effort was made to reference
    and describe the relationship to the prior work as if you were
    extending someone else's research. For example, if your name is Joe
    Smith:

    > "In previous work [1,2], Smith presented a new branch
    > predictor for .... In this paper, we extend their work by ..."
    >
    > Bibliography
    >
    > - [1] Joe Smith, "A Parallel Architecture for ...,"
    >   Proceedings of PACT 2004.
    > - [2] Joe Smith, "A Compilation Technique for ...,"
    >   Proceedings of PACT 2005.

-   Your submission must be formatted for black-and-white printers and
    not color printers. This is especially true for plots and graphs in
    the paper.

-   Please make sure that the labels on your graphs are readable without
    the aid of a magnifying glass.

-   Please number the pages.

-   The paper must be submitted in PDF. We cannot accept any other
    format, and we must be able to print the document just as we receive
    it. We suggest that you use only the four widely used printer fonts:
    Times, Helvetica, Courier and Symbol.

## Conflicts of Interest

To ensure a fair and high-quality reviewing process we ask ALL authors
of a submitted paper to register their conflicts at the submission site.
If a paper is found to have an undeclared conflict that causes a problem
OR if a paper is found to declare false conflicts in order to abuse or
game the review system, the paper may be rejected. Please declare a
conflict of interest with the following people for any author of your
paper. Do not limit yourself to only the PC members. A conflict occurs
in the following cases:

-   Between adviser and advisee forever.

-   Between family members forever.

-   Between people who have collaborated in the last 5 years. This
    collaboration can consist of a joint research or development
    project, a joint paper, or when there is direct funding from the
    potential reviewer (as opposed to company funding) to an author of
    the paper. Co-participation in professional activities, such as
    tutorials or studies, is not cause for conflict. When in doubt, the
    author should check with the PC chair.

-   Between people from same institution or who were in the same
    institution in the last 5 years.

-   Between people whose relationship prevents the reviewer from being
    objective in his/her assessment. Service collaborations, such as
    co-authoring a report for a professional organization, serving on a
    program committee, or co-presenting tutorials, do not themselves
    create a conflict of interest. Co-authoring a paper that is a
    compendium of various projects with no true collaboration among the
    projects does not constitute a conflict among the authors of the
    different projects.

## Artifact Evaluation

Authors of accepted PACT 2022 papers are invited to formally submit
their supporting materials for Artifact Evaluation. Submission is
voluntary. The Artifact Evaluation process is run by a separate
committee whose task is to assess if artifacts supporting the work
described in the papers are available and functional, and (some of)
experimental results are reproducible.

We encourage authors to prepare their artifacts for submission and make
them more portable, reusable and customizable using open-source
frameworks including [OCCAM](https://occam.cs.pitt.edu/),
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [reprozip](https://www.reprozip.org/),
[CodeOcean](https://codeocean.com/) and [CK](https://cknowledge.io/docs/).

Papers that successfully go through the Artifact Evaluation process will
receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves. Authors of
such papers will have an option to include their Artifact Appendix to
the final paper (up to 2 pages). Authors are also encouraged to make
their artifacts publicly available, for example using the Code Ocean
platform.
