    ## Monday, October 10, 2022

    #### Keynote: Dr. Fred Chong, Department of Computer Science, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60637-1468, USA

    Fred Chong is the Seymour Goodman Professor in the Department of
    Computer Science at the University of Chicago and the Chief Scientist
    for Quantum Software at ColdQuanta. He is also Lead Principal
    Investigator for the EPiQC Project (Enabling Practical-scale Quantum
    Computing), an NSF Expedition in Computing. Chong is a member of the
    National Quantum Advisory Committee (NQIAC) which provides advice
    to the President and Secretary of Energy on the National Quantum
    Initiative Program. In 2020, he co-founded Super.tech, a quantum
    software company, which was acquired by ColdQuanta in 2022. Chong
    received his Ph.D. from MIT in 1996 and was a faculty member and
    Chancellor's fellow at UC Davis from 1997-2005. He was also a
    Professor of Computer Science, Director of Computer Engineering,
    and Director of the Greenscale Center for Energy-Efficient Computing
    at UCSB from 2005-2015. He is a recipient of the NSF CAREER award,
    the Intel Outstanding Researcher Award, and 13 best paper awards.

    **Keynote Talk - Closing the Gap between Quantum Algorithms and Machines with Hardware-Software Co-Design**

    Quantum computing is at an inflection point, where 127-qubit
    machines are deployed, and 1000-qubit machines are perhaps only a
    few years away.  These machines have the potential to fundamentally
    change our concept of what is computable and demonstrate practical
    applications in areas such as quantum chemistry, optimization,
    and quantum simulation.  Yet a significant resource gap remains
    between practical quantum algorithms and real machines.  A promising
    approach to closing this gap is to design software that is aware
    of the key physical properties of emerging quantum technologies.
    I will illustrate this approach with some of our recent work that
    focuses on techniques that break traditional abstractions and
    inform hardware design, including compiling programs directly
    to analog control pulses,  computing with ternary quantum bits,
    2.5D architectures for surface codes, and exploiting long-distance
    communication and tolerating atom loss in neutral-atom machines.

    #### Keynote: Dr. Massimiliano Di Ventra, Department of Physics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093-0319, USA

    Massimiliano Di Ventra obtained his undergraduate degree in Physics
    *summa cum laude* from the University of Trieste (Italy) in 1991 and
    did his PhD studies at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology
    in Lausanne in 1993-1997. He is now professor of Physics at the
    University of California, San Diego. Di Ventra's research interests
    are in condensed-matter theory and unconventional computing. He
    has been invited to deliver more than 300 talks worldwide on these
    topics. He has published more than 200 papers in refereed journals,
    4 textbooks, and has 7 granted patents (3 foreign). He is a fellow
    of the IEEE, the American Physical Society, the Institute of Physics,
    and a foreign member of Academia Europaea. In 2018 he was named Highly
    Cited Researcher by Clarivate Analytics, he is the recipient of the
    2020 Feynman Prize for theory in Nanotechnology, and is a 2022 IEEE
    Nanotechnology Council Distinguished Lecturer. He is the co-founder
    of [MemComputing, Inc](http://memcpu.com/).

    **Keynote Talk - MemComputing: Fundamentals and Applications**

    MemComputing is a new physics-based approach to computation
    that employs *time non-locality* (memory) to both process and
    store information on the same physical location. (M. Di Ventra,
    *MemComputing: Fundamentals and Applications*, Oxford University
    Press, 2022.) Its digital version is designed to solve combinatorial
    optimization problems. A practical realization of digital memcomputing
    machines (DMMs) can be accomplished via circuits of non-linear
    dynamical systems with memory engineered so that periodic orbits and
    chaos can be avoided. A given logic (or algebraic) problem is first
    mapped into this type of dynamical system whose point attractors
    represent the solutions of the original problem. A DMM then finds
    the solution via a succession of elementary avalanches (instantons)
    whose role is to eliminate configurations of logical inconsistency
    ("logical defects") from the circuit. I will discuss the physics
    behind MemComputing and show many examples of its applicability
    to various combinatorial optimization problems, Machine Learning,
    and Quantum Mechanics, demonstrating its advantages over traditional
    approaches and even quantum computing. Work supported by DARPA, DOE,
