      PACT is a long-running and unique conference at the intersection of
      classical parallel architectures and compilers that brings together
      researchers from architecture, compilers, programming languages, and
      applications to present and discuss their latest research results.
      Applications as a driver for innovations in architecture and compilers
      are an important theme of the conference.
